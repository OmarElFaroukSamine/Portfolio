                            Ever since I was a kid, discovering new technologies has piqued my interest. I've dived into
                            the
                            world of computer architecture at a very young age, thanks to computers being available at
                            my
                            home. I used to always open my countless broken computers and troubleshoot them by myself,
                            and
                            it was one of the things that created a love for problem-solving in me.

                        <p>
                            When I started high school, I started getting introduced to programming and coding, thanks
                            to my
                            amazing role model, My brother Mohammed Samine. Ever since then, I've been trying to improve
                            my
                            skills in the field, I've acquired a lot of skills in various programming languages like
                            Python,
                            and C++. I've also gained knowledge in web development technologies like HTML5, Javascript,
                            CSS,
                            and PHP.

                        <p>I feel like my skills and my love for problem-solving are the drives that make me have
                            potential
                            in the field of computer science. I'm looking forward to finishing my studies and becoming a

                        <p>In the last four years, I've had the chance to gain a lot of experience in Python. Since it

                            programming language I learnt, I first started using it in high school but it was in ISTA
                            where I really
                            grasped it. I learnt a lot of the programming concepts using it, like data structures, basic
                            control structures,
                            Object Oriented Programming GUI etc..., and I've been using it ever since for personal
                            projects and aim to use it
                            for future projects.

                            that i studied there. I started using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create basic websites after
                            that i dove deeper into the world of Javascript. since I already knew a lot of the basics of
                            programming from studying Python before it. I found it kind of easy to pick up Javascript.
                            Since then I've gained a lot of knowledge in it. and I'm currently learning other Javascript
                            such as Jquery, React and Vue.js.

                            understanding of the syntax of C++ and how it works, and there I dove deeper into its other
                            concepts like pointers and seeing OOP from another point of view etc.</p>

                            1st year of middle school, started learning about WLAN, LAN and WAN. it was an
                            interesting subject that I would get into more when I wanted to understand the blueprint of
                            the internet. since then I've gained a lot of knowledge on the technologies behind it like
                            packets, the OSI model, and different protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS etc. I want to dive a
                            bit deeper into this subject in the near future.

                            and experience on it since almost ever since I remember, I've always had PCs that ran into a
                            lot
                            of problems that I've had to troubleshoot on my own, I've opened my first computer at the
                            age of
                            9. it was probably trying to fix a fan not being connected, a having some issues with the
                            sound
                            card. After that, it became a common occurrence for me to open my PC to either fix it or
