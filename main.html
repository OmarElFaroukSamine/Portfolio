                        Ever since I was a kid, discovering new technologies has piqued my interest. I've dived into the
                        world of computer architecture at a very young age, thanks to computers being available at my
                        home. I used to always open my countless broken computers and troubleshoot them by myself, and
                        it was one of the things that created a love for problem-solving in me.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I started high school, I started getting introduced to programming and coding, thanks to my
                        amazing role model, My brother Mohammed Samine. Ever since then, I've been trying to improve my
                        skills in the field, I've acquired a lot of skills in various programming languages like Python,
                        and C++. I've also gained knowledge in web development technologies like HTML5, Javascript, CSS,
                        and PHP.

                    </p>
                    <p>I feel like my skills and my love for problem-solving are the drives that make me have potential
                        in the field of computer science. I'm looking forward to finishing my studies and becoming a
                        driving force in the industry !!
